***Please nots: I did not create any of the HTML, Functions, or CSS in this repository. This repository was created by DevMtn for me to practice with.*** See below for details and requirements of this assessment with DevMtn:
- In this assessment I created 3 tests
- I also created a Bug Report for the bug that was placed in the code for me to find
- I also deployed the site through AWS (Please note: it is not active right now in AWS currently)
